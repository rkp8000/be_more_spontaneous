    "\n",
    "We would like to build a network that can remember and recall pairwise associations between a large number of neural assemblies. This network should be *non-plastic*, using persistent electrical activity only. To do this efficiently, so that we don't need an \"association unit\" for every pair of assemblies, we collect the assemblies into groups, such that the network can only remember associations between assemblies in different groups. One might imagine the specific grouping of assemblies as acting as a sort of prior over associations, such that assemblies in certain groups would be \"easier\" to associate. Under this architecture, although we lose the ability to remember certain pairs of associations, this ends up being a small number, so that the network can still remember $O(N^2)$ associations, if $N$ is the number of original assemblies.\n",

    "\n",
    "For the sake of simplicity, we consider a network consisting of several types of assembly that each have a \"voltage\" and a \"firing rate\". The mathematical formulation is that of a rate-based model. Each assembly type is defined by its integration timescale, resting potential, \"steepness\", threshold (steepness and threshold govern the relationship between voltage and firing rate), and connectivity to other units. Assemblies of the same type all have the same parameters, but may have different voltages and firing rates, depending on their input, etc."

    "1. \"Down\" - with no external input, a unit goes to its \"down\" state: resting voltage and minimal firing rate\n",
    "1. \"Up\" - a unit with a sufficiently strong excitatory (E) self-connection can be pushed by a strong input into an \"up\" state of high voltage and near-maximal firing rate and maintain this state in the absence of further input.\n",
    "1. \"Poised\" - we use this term to refer to a unit receiving weak input from another unit in its upstate. A poised unit is not active but will more easily cross its activation threshold than a unit at its resting potential.\n",

When the RFM-unit is up, the RF-unit is poised. The RF-unit sends an E connection back to its RFM-unit, so that if the RF-unit is activated, the RFM-unit will move to its up-state.\n",
