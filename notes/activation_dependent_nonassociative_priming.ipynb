    "### Time-dependent changes in distributions of neural activity as a substrate for memory\n",
    "\n",
    "Brain activity consists of spatiotemporally structured patterns ([Mohajerani et al., 2013][Mohajerani], [Carrillo-Reid et al., 2015][Carrillo-Reid]), and the probability distribution governing the occurrence of these patterns changes over time. How this distribution changes typically depends on previous neural activity and can be considered the neural correlate of memory. A specific theme in memory-related experiments is that the patterns observed during one period of time are often biased towards replay or reflection of patterns that have occurred previously. For example, the \"offline\" replay of sequential neural firing patterns originally seen during an active portion of the task has been observed in a multitude of mammalian brain areas, including hippocampus ([Nadasdy et al., 1999][Nadasdy], [Louie and Wilson, 2001][Louie]), prefrontal cortex ([Euston et al., 2007][Euston]), and visual cortex ([Ji and Wilson 2007][Ji], [Han et al., 2008][Han], [Eagleman and Dragoi, 2012][Eagleman]), as well as in RA in songbirds ([Dave and Margoliash, 2000][Dave]). Behaviorally, experiments in which human subjects successfully repeat previously heard sentences when cued to do so ([Potter and Lombardi, 1998][Potter]) also strongly indicate a change in neural activity  reflective of activity experienced in the past.\n",

    "### The insufficiency of STDP as the primary memory mechanism\n",
    "\n",
    "The mechanism typically invoked to explain the \"embedding\" of sequential activity patterns into a neural network is spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) ([Bi and Poo 2001][Bi]). STDP postulates that the sequential firing of two synaptically connected neurons will result in an increase in the strength of the synapse from the neuron that fired first to the neuron that fired second. For example, if the activation of a neural ensemble A is followed by a connected neural ensemble B, STDP proposes that the synaptic connections from A to B should increase their strength. Then, the next time A activates, B will received increased input and will have a higher probability of activating. Indeed, STDP can cause the emergence of repeatable activity sequences in realistic model networks ([Klampfl and Maass 2013][Klampfl]).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, while STDP is undoubtedly important for many neurophysiological phenomena, there are several reasons why it is improbable that it alone is sufficient for the embedding of sequential activity patterns into a network. First, while sequential neural replay has been observed after only one ([Eagleman and Dragoi, 2012][Eagleman]) or a few ([Han et al., 2008][Han]) presentations of the original stimulus, and in human behavioral studies subjects can repeat back sentences immediately after hearing them ([Potter and Lombardi 1998][Potter]), the changes in synaptic strength evoked by STDP are typically quite small ([Bi and Poo 2001][Bi], [Caporale and Dan 2008][Caporale]), and it is unlikely that such changes could affect the distribution over sequential activation patterns enough to significantly bias it toward a recently occurring pattern. Additionally, even if such changes were significant they would strongly interfere with memories previously existing in the network, as the network would have no way of distinguishing whether the strength of a synaptic connection was due to a recent modification or whether it corresponded to a long-term memory. This leads us to consider an additional problem with STDP. Ideally, one would like memory-specific modifications of the network structure to be conditional on a global signal potentially occurring some time after the relevant activity pattern, such as a reward or punishment signal in response to an animal's recent motor sequence. In order for this to occur the neural activation sequence would have to be temporarily *tagged*, and only if it was deemed behaviorally relevant would the network identify the relevant synapses and modify them accordingly. Finally, in order for STDP to function, the pre- and postsynapic action potentials have to occur within about 20 ms of one another ([Bi and Poo 2001][Bi]), a timescale that is much faster than many naturalistic stimulus or motor timescales.\n",

    "### Nonassociative memory mechanisms at different timescales\n",
    "\n",
    "STDP is fundamentally an associative memory mechanism. That is, it acts on associations or connections between pairs of neurons or pairs of neural ensembles. It is natural, of course, to assume that sequential activity patterns, in which the activation of one specific neural ensemble should lead to the activation of another with a probability greater than chance, must be learned via associative mechanisms. In this paper we instead ask whether nonassociative mechanisms could also play a significant role in learning the associations and sequences necessary for embedding spatiotemporal activity patterns into a network. Whereas associative memory mechanisms are activation-dependent modifications of *connections* between pairs of ensembles, we define nonassociative memory mechanisms to simply be activation-dependent modifications of the excitability of individual ensembles, regardless of their connections to other ensembles in the network. Below we review experiments in which nonassociative memory mechanisms have been observed and investigated.\n",
    "\n",
    "We focus on evidence that activating a neuron one or more times with a stimulus increases its excitability in response to subsequent stimuli. Such increases in the excitability of individual neurons occur at many timescales and in many brain areas, including hippocampus, cerebellum, and neocortex; they typically manifest via either increasingly strong responses to a train of depolarizing current pulses or a decrease in firing threshold as more stimuli are presented (reviewed in [Zhang and Linden 2003][Zhang]). Molecular mechanisms implicated in excitability changes occurring over the timescale of dozens of seconds or more include mechanisms dependent on NMDA-receptors and Ca2 ([Zhang and Linden 2003][Zhang]), as well as decreases in the active population of A-type potassium channels (which open at high voltages and thus slow the onset of action potentials) ([Jung and Hoffman 2009][Jung]).\n",
    "\n",
    "Excitability changes on the order of seconds, which is closer to the timescale of working memory, are also observed experimentally. The clearest evidence of this phenomenon is repetition enhancement. In a typical experiment, an animal is presented with a target stimulus and then after a short delay on the order of seconds (potentially containing intervening stimuli) with a test stimulus, and the animal must decide whether the test stimulus matched the target. In many experiments it has been observed that a significant percentage of neurons exhibit increased responses to the second presentation of the stimulus (i.e., when the test matches the target), suggesting an increase in the neurons' overall excitability. For example, many stimulus-selective neurons in the inferotemporal (IT) cortex of monkeys responded more strongly to a given stimulus in a stream of visual stimuli when that stimulus matched a target stimulus they had seen at the beginning of the trial, relative to when the same stimulus had not been seen earlier ([Miller and Desimone 1994][Miller]). Similar examples of such repetition enhancement have been seen in V4 ([Hayden and Gallant 2013][Hayden]), as well as in posterior parietal cortex (PPC) and MT (reviewed in [Tartaglia et al., 2015][Tartaglia]). Further, neuroimaging studies in humans have shown that activity in sensory cortex that persists during the delay period of working memory tasks, and which presumably allows the subject to recall the target stimulus, typically contains a high level of information about the sensory content of the target, as opposed to simply indicating whether it was remembered or not ([Sreenivasan et al., 2014][Sreenivasan]). To try to explain delay activity and repetition enhancement in a manner consistent with experimental evidence, [Tartaglia et al., 2015A][Tartaglia A] developed a simple model network based on recurrent excitation in which stimulus-selective repetition enhancement resulted from local excitability increases caused by stimulus-selective persistent delay activity. \n",
    "\n",
    "While we believe there is much evidence that subsets of neurons in the brain exhibit short-term activation-dependent increases in excitability, and that this on its own merits an investigation into such a phenomenon's effect on the time-dependent distribution of sequential neural activity patterns, we also think it is important to highlight the simplicity of such a mechanism. Specifically, a short-term increase in the excitabilities of recently activated individual neuronal ensembles can be achieved relatively easily through persistent electrical activity alone (as demonstrated by [Tartaglia et al., 2015A][Tartaglia A]), and the memory is natural to \"read out\": a global input to all the ensembles will activate the more excitable ones (i.e., those held in memory) before the less excitable ones. On the other hand, a mechanism in which persistent neural activity explicitly encodes distinguishable sequences of recently activated ensembles must be considerably more complex, and it is not obvious how such persistent activity could be easily decoded so as to bias subsequent neural activity toward replay.\n",

    "### The goal of this work\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this work is to elucidate some of the qualitative consequences we expect nonassociative activation-dependent increases in neural excitability, which we henceforth call **nonassociative priming**, to have in regard to shaping the distributions of sequential neural activity patterns. We do not aim to say that nonassociative priming can account for all memory phenomena, but rather to demonstrate that it can make significant computationally relevant contributions to associative and sequential memory that have not been addressed previously. To do this we investigate a simple randomly connected winner-take-all network with probabilistic binary activations. Each node in the network corresponds to an ensemble of similarly tuned neurons, but to remain conservative we do not model the neurons individually. By construction, such a network exhibits sparse, stochastic activation patterns that sometimes fall along stereotyped trajectories. The model network exhibits gating of external drive inputs by spontaneous activity, as has been observed experimentally ([Luczak et al., 2013][Luczak]), as well as sequential pattern matching. In this paper we focus specifically on short-term nonassociative priming (i.e., which probably results biophysically from recurrent excitation within an ensemble), though in the future it will be worthwhile to consider longer timescales also. We show that when we augment our model with a simple phenomenological implementation of nonassociative priming, the network recapitulates the qualitative aspects of several memory-related phenomena, including sequential replay, memory-dependent modulation of input-output computations, and single-trial learning of sequential stimulus patterns. In doing this, we illustrate how nonassociative priming temporarily and reversibly changes the functional connectivity structure of the network and how its ability to \"imprint\" associative and sequential memories into a network is enabled but also constrained by the underlying anatomical connectivity.\n",
